1. rhoInf is the freestream density.
2. magUinf is the magnitude of the freestream velocity.
3. The source code for the forces and forceCoeffs are located, respectively, in OpenFOAM-1.6/src/postProcessing/forces/ and OpenFOAM-1.6/src/postProcessing/forceCoeffs/
4. The equations of CL and CD are defined in OpenFOAM-1.6/src/postProcessing/forceCoeffs/forceCoeffs.C

OpenFOAM first calculates a total force, by multiplying it with the directions of each component, this force is divided into its components (lift/drag). These components are then divided by the referenceDensity multiplied with the refArea which leads to CL and CD
Hi, for calculating total Forces in OpenFOAM, integrated the pressure Field over the surfaces and projection of this forces in drag or lift direction Division Pdyn*Aref gives the cd and cl Coeff

 total force on the cylinder comes from both pressure differences around the cylinder and from friction. The drag force (also called the in-line force) acts in the direction of the flow, while the lift force acts in the transverse direction.


1st calc force---> then Cd
force is  by pressure and friction
